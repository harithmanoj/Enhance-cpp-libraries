# About Enhance C++ Libraries

Enhance C++ Libraries is a collection of C++ classes and functions to make life easier.

The library is primarily header based barring the logger module. Hence it is easily 
integrated to your code base.

The Library expects C++17 for compilation and has not been checked for compatibility 
with older versions.
